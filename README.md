#TComputerShop
 
This web application is an online computer part store where users can browse through different computer parts and add them to the shopping cart. 
The user must sign in before they can check out with their items. Once the users have placed an order they can click 
on a drop down by there name to see there account details and also see all of the orders they have placed along 
with the status of them.
I have made an Admin area where any user logged in that has the role of Admin can view all of the orders. The Admin
can also view all of the users that have registered for the site which they have access to locking/unlocking the 
indiviudal users account. They can also make a user an Admin or take away there Admin privilege.
The Admin also has access to the web pages where they can add new products to the store, they can also edit or delete the Products.
